# VSDSquadron FPGA Mini – RGB LED Control Project
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Verilog-based RGB LED controller on the VSDSquadron FPGA Mini board. The design utilizes the internal high-frequency oscillator (SB_HFOSC), a frequency counter, and the SB_RGBA_DRV primitive to generate visible color transitions on the onboard RGB LED.

The project was developed using the open-source iCE40 FPGA toolchain and programmed via SPI flash.

#Project Objectives
- Understand the provided Verilog code for RGB LED control
- Create and verify the PCF pin constraint file
- Integrate the design with the VSDSquadron FPGA Mini board
- Build and flash the design using open-source FPGA tools
- Document the complete workflow and observations
